# Control Flow in C

## Purpose
Control flow determines how a C program makes decisions and repeats actions.

---

## Core Elements

### Conditionals
- `if / else` → execute code based on conditions
- `switch` → compare one variable to multiple constant cases
- `==` is comparison, `=` is assignment
- `0` = false, non-zero = true

---

### Loops
- `while` → runs while condition is true
- `for` → used when iteration count is known
- Always ensure a clear exit condition

---

### Loop Control
- `break` → exits loop or switch
- `continue` → skips current iteration

---

### Operators
- Comparison: `== != < > <= >=`
- Logical: `&& || !`
- Short-circuit evaluation applies

---

## Key Rules
- Avoid infinite loops
- Keep conditions simple and readable
- Use `switch` instead of long `if/else` chains when possible

---

## Outcome
You should be able to:
- Write safe conditions
- Control execution flow
- Read and debug loop logic
